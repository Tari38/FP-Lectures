# **FRAMEWORKS**

*A framework is 'an essential supporting structure of a building, vehicle, or object.' In programming we often utilise frameworks for many different situations. Usually they have been written by people looking to solve or ease a 'problem' and then they decide to share their opinionated 'solution'. Because of this, choosing a framework can be a very personal choice.*

## **Choosing a framework**
At time of writing, this is a recent list of some popular html/css frameworks. You can use tools like [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) or [StackShare](https://stackshare.io/tools/trending) to get a temperature check on what is popular. If you are joining a team, you may find that frameworks have already been decided on and you are required to learn specific ones. It's good a keep an eye on any new frameworks so you can have a brief look and see if they appeal to you. The best way to evaluate a framework is to build something small in it!

### **Consideration points**
- What you want to create?
- It is already decided by the project owners.
- Developer skillset.
- Developer wants to learn?

### **Red Flags**
- Not knowing the language used.
- Hard to read documentation.
- Hard to get started.
